I am a **CS Ph.D** student at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)](https://rpi.edu/) in Troy, New York. I have received my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from [Visvesvaraya Technological University](https://vtu.ac.in/) in Bangalore, India. My undergraduate thesis titled **Cross Lingual Transfer Learning for Natural language Understanding** was advised by Ms. Snehalatha N and was generously supported (funded) by **Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST)**.<br> 


Research Statement
======

My research interests lie in the field of **Multimodal Deep Learning**, which involves the integration of **vision** and **language**. My goal is to design and build computational tools using Artificial Intelligence for Ecological Conservation. Currently, I am funded by the **[NSF Institute ICICLE](https://icicle.osu.edu/)** and am working under the guidance of **[Professor Charles V Stewart](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl%253Den%2526user%253D7egtxu0AAAAJ%2526view_op%253Dlist_works%2526sortby%253Dpubdate)** in the **[VISION Lab](https://chuckvisionlab.github.io/)** at the **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute**, specifically in the **Department of Computer Science**.

I have a keen interest in all aspects of how Artificial Intelligence can be applied across various scientific domains to enhance the quality of life. Recently, I have been intrigued by works related to **mathematical reasoning in large language models**. In the past, my work has been focused on expanding the use of NLP technologies to a broader set of languages, particularly those that are **low-resource**. My research aimed to efficiently leverage large multilingual models to perform tasks in low-resource languages using **cross-lingual and domain transfer learning**.
