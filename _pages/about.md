I am a **CS Ph.D** student at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)](https://rpi.edu/) in Troy, New York. I have received my Bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from [Visvesvaraya Technological University](https://vtu.ac.in/) in Bangalore, India. My undergraduate thesis titled **Cross Lingual Transfer Learning for Natural language Understanding** was advised by Ms. Snehalatha N and was generously supported (funded) by **Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST)**.<br> 


Research Statement
======

My research interests are in the field of **Deep Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**. I would like to work towards broadening the use of NLP technologies to a wider set of languages, particularly **low-resource languages**. Through my research, I would like to work towards efficiently leveraging large multilingual models to perform tasks in low-resource languages using **cross-lingual and domain transfer learning** since it would profoundly impact designing systems, especially for low-income regions of the world. In turn, it will be helpful to remove bias and foster technological inclusion.
